# sbe307_Task 1 --> Matrix Multplication

## Name: Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed Ibrahim
## Sec: 2
## B.N.: 11

### Refrences :
[![Matrix_Operator_Overloading](https://gist.github.com/jacyzon/4189944)]
I have used this class as a starter file for the matrix class but `I changed the implementatoin of the operator * to be the naiive approch`.
In addition to that I added a lot of utilty method to help in the implementatoin of the strassen algorithm like `get_ncols`, `get_nrows`
, `shape`, `get_vector`, `expand_right`, `stack_bottom`, `get_sub_row`, `get_sub_matrix`.

[![WIKI_Strassen](https://gist.github.com/jacyzon/4189944https://gist.github.com/jacyzon/4189944)]
The algorithm definition of strassen.

### Implement this task using c++
In this task you are required to fill 3 files
1. naive.cpp --> implement the naive matrix multiplication algorithm
2. strassen.cpp --> implement strassen divide and conquer algorithm
3. stress.cpp --> implement stress test using both files

Read the comments carefully and fill the missing lines


### General Notes
- This is an individual based assignment.
- The due date for the submission of this phase is Sunday, 07/11/2021 at 11:59 pm.
- Each hour delay will lead to one-point reduction in the homeworkâ€™s grade.
- Your code should be clear, understandable, and documented (comments). Follow a consistent naming convention for variables and functions.
- You are permitted to discuss the following problems with others in the class. However, you must write up your own solutions to these problems. Any indication to the contrary will be considered an act of academic dishonesty. 
- Please review the definition of cheating in the first presentation.
